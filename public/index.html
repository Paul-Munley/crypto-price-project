			content="This is a minimalist SPA that allows you to see the top cryptocurrencies and their current prices in USD, BTC, ETH. This page uses React, Redux, and React Router to accomplish this. It has a dynamic search bar that will change the search results based off what the user is typing. Once a cryptocurrency is clicked it will route to the detail page for that specific cryptocurrency. This site uses HTTP GET Requests from CryptoCompare to show the search results with the cryptocurrencies logos and also uses HTTP GET Requests from CoinGecko to display the specific cryptocurrency details effectively."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
